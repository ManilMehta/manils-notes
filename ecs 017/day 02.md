	convention:
			we need to understand our conventions, and the computer's convention.

A computer "understands" on/off


2) Positive Integers
Let us understand first our convention about numbers :
	two thousand twenty six
		2026
convention #1: reading left to right

2026 (2 thousands, 0 hundreds, 2 tens, 6 digit)
(2 x 1000) + (0 x 100) + (2 x 10) + (6)
(2 x 10^3) + (0 x 10^2) + (2 x 10^1) + 6(10^0)


on the computer
try to mimic 
(a * x^2^3) + (b * x ^2^2) + (c x 10) + d

(1 1 1 1)

1 x 2^3 + 1 x 2^2 + 1 x 2 + 1 = 15 sub 10

1 bit => 8 bits = 1 byte

1 bit (only one number (0 or 1))
4 bits (15 largest, by 16 numbers)
n bits (2^(n) -1 , but you can represent 2^n)
